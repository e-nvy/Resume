\header{Projects}
{\textbf{Multi-Machine Web Application Deployment with Vagrant}} {\sl Vagrant, Bash, TomCat, Mariadb, Mem Cached, Nginx} \hfill https://github.com/e-nvy/Multi-Machine-Web-Application-Deployment\\
The Multi-Machine Web Application Deployment project showcased a comprehensive setup of a web application across five virtual machines using Vagrant and VirtualBox as the virtualization provider. The application stack included a database server (DB), a memcached server (Memcache), a RabbitMQ server (RabbitMQ), and two web servers running Tomcat and Nginx. Utilizing Vagrant\textquotesingle{}s power, I efficiently managed these virtual machine environments, allowing for seamless deployment and scaling of the application components.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{Multi-Container Web Application Deployment with Docker}} {\sl Docker, TomCat, Nginx, Mariadb} \hfill https://github.com/e-nvy/Multi-Container-Web-Application-Deployment-with-Docker\\
This project showcased the integration of various components within isolated Docker containers. The application stack included a database server (DB), memcached server (Memcache), RabbitMQ server (RabbitMQ), and two web servers running Tomcat and Nginx. By deploying these components in separate containers, I achieved efficient resource management and simplified scalability. Docker\textquotesingle{}s containerization allowed for easy deployment of the entire web application stack, providing a reliable and flexible environment for hosting the application.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{Construction and Maintenance Cell in Frappe Framework (Python-based ERP Project)}} {\sl Frappe Framework, Python, Nginx, Mariadb} \hfill erp.gndec.ac.in\\
In this project, I developed a web application named \textquotedbl{}Construction and Maintenance Cell\textquotedbl{} using the Frappe framework, a Python-based ERP platform. The application aimed to streamline construction and maintenance processes for businesses. I set up monolithic services, including email and LDAP authentication, and implemented a microservice Single Sign-On (SSO) for enhanced security. Implementing multi-tenancy using Nginx ensured efficient resource utilization for multiple clients.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{Dockerized Marketing Site}} {\sl Docker, Html, Css} \hfill https://github.com/e-nvy/DockerizedMarketingSite\\
In the Dockerized Marketing Site project, I demonstrated the process of containerizing a dynamic marketing website template using Docker. By leveraging Docker, I transformed the website template from www.tooplate.com into a Docker container. This containerization process simplified the deployment, management, and distribution of the marketing website. Docker\textquotesingle{}s isolation and portability features ensured the website could be easily run on various environments without compatibility issues\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{Library Management System}} {\sl Frappe, Python, Mariadb} \hfill erp.gndec.ac.in\\
I designed and implemented a Library Management System for our college, utilizing the Frappe framework. The system boasts a well-structured database, enabling efficient library membership management. It allows users to track individual memberships, borrowed articles (books, magazines, and newspapers), and dates of returns. Moreover, it efficiently calculates fines for late book returns, ensuring smooth library operations and enhanced user experience.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{Payroll Management System}} {\sl Frappe, Python, Mariadb} \hfill erp.gndec.ac.in\\
My team and I successfully crafted a Payroll Management System for our College using the Frappe framework. The system efficiently calculates and processes teacher/employee salaries. It automates email notifications, generates salary slips, and seamlessly integrates with the bank, ensuring a streamlined and error-free payroll process.\\
